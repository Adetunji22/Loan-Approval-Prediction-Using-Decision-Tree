# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree

**INTRODUCTION**
In this project, a meticulous exploration of applicant profiles and loan characteristics was undertaken through predictive modeling on a loan approval dataset. This initiative seeks to harness the potential of data-driven insights to construct a predictive model capable of evaluating and foreseeing loan approval outcomes, by delving into the intricate interplay between applicant attributes, loan parameters, and historical approval data.
The model's ability to accurately predict loan approvals can greatly streamline the decision-making process for lending institutions. By identifying patterns in applicant profiles and loan characteristics, the model aids in objectively determining whether a given loan application is likely to be approved or denied.

**ABOUT THE DATASET**

The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution. It includes various factors such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to develop models and algorithms that predict the likelihood of loan approval based on the given features.

**CONCLUSION**

Performed data cleaning, EDA, data visualization and statistics techniques to analyze the loan approval insights, and built a decision tree algorithm to predict loan approval outcomes. Upon implementing the decision tree algorithm for loan approval prediction, the model exhibited remarkable performance, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 96 percent. The accuracy rate of 96 percent indicates that the model correctly predicted the loan approval status for the vast majority of cases in our dataset.
